# Media Portal

Web (media) portal for displaying my movie, tv show and comicbook collection.

### More details

I use [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) to manage my movie and tv show collection, which stores all information in a mysql database. To have a overview about my comicbook collection I created another mysql database.
To display (or delete/edit/create) all this informations in a browser I created this portal. Besides displaying the information it provides a way for me to download my digital files.
**This is for personal use only!** 

### Built With

* PHP and my own MVC framework
* MYSQL
* HTML, JavaScript, CSS

### Provides

* A full html/xml documentation about the php source code
* Unit tests (coming soon)
